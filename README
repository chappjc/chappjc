# Hi, I’m Jonathan Chappelow

I'm a software engineer, technical leader, and backend systems architect with a focus on distributed systems, applied cryptography, and performance-critical infrastructure. Rooted in computational imaging and scientific research. I thrive on designing elegant, scalable systems—especially where decentralization, systems and protocol design, R&D, and strong typing intersect.

> 🔧 I build backends, protocols, and **teams**.

### Highlighted Work

#### 🗃️ [kwil-db](https://github.com/jchappelow/kwil-db) (Lead Developer, Head of Engineering @ [Kwil](https://kwil.com))

A distributed database for web3 using blockchain concepts for authorization and replication, with a PostgreSQL-backed datastore.

- Led system architecture and technical direction.
- Authored the PostgreSQL-backed datastore, libp2p-based networking layer, and JSON-RPC APIs.
- Implemented telemetry instrumentation, cryptographic identity systems, peer discovery, and many key features of the node software.
- Mentored engineers, reviewed all core code, and built a high-caliber engineering team.

#### 🔄 [DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex)

- Co-architect and lead developer for the open-source DCRDEX project, a fully non-custodial, cross-chain atomic swap system.
- Backend logic, PostgreSQL data layers, and atomic swap trade management.

#### 🧭 [dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata)

- Blockchain explorer and REST API service for Decred.
- Contributor, architect, and maintainer.
